This project has started as a mid-term project where we were assigned to use React as front-end and NodeJS as back-end and a server of our choice.
Since both of us had an affection towards music, and wanted both to do something that is not the same CRUD or regular MERN stack project that will actually make us sit and work and sweat every little detail and improve each sound until we are satisfied with the result.
